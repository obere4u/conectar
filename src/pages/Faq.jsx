      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):</h2>
      <h4>What is Conectar?</h4>
      <p>
        Conectar is a platform that connects service providers with service
        recipients. It acts as an escrow service, ensuring safe and secure
        transactions between the parties involved.
      </p>
      <h4>How does Conectar work?</h4>
      <p>
        Service providers can post the services they offer and Recipients have
        the discretion to accept or decline proposals. Once a proposal is
        accepted, the Recipient and Provider enter into a direct contractual
        relationship, and Conectar facilitates the transaction and holds funds
        in escrow until satisfactory completion of the services.
      </p>
      <h4>Is Conectar responsible for providing the services?</h4>
      <p>
        No, Conectar does not provide the actual services. It connects
        Recipients with Providers and acts as an intermediary to ensure a smooth
        and secure transaction process.
      </p>
      <h4>What is the role of Conectar as an escrow service?</h4>
      <p>
        Conectar holds the funds in a secure account until the agreed-upon
        services are satisfactorily completed. It helps protect both Recipients
        and Providers by ensuring that the payment is held securely and released
        only when the services have been successfully provided.
      </p>
      <h4>Are there any fees associated with using Conectar?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes, Conectar charges a service fee for each transaction conducted on
        the platform. The fee is a percentage of the total transaction amount
        and will be clearly displayed before the engagement is confirmed.
        Additional payment processing fees may also apply and will be disclosed
        to the parties.
      </p>
      <h4>What happens if there is a dispute?</h4>
      <p>
        In the event of a dispute, Conectar may mediate between the parties to
        reach a resolution. If a resolution cannot be reached, the parties may
        pursue other legal remedies available to them.
      </p>

        time. Users will be notified of any material changes via email or

        will constitute acceptance of the revised Terms.
      </p>
      <h4>What happens to ongoing transactions if I terminate my account?</h4>
      <p>
        If you terminate your account, any ongoing transactions or agreements
        will be handled according to the agreed-upon terms between you and the
        other party involved.(This does not apply to accounts that violate these
